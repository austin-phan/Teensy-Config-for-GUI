# VA Motorsports Live GUI

## Project Overview
This project provides a real-time GUI for the VA Motorsports team to collect and visualize car performance data both on-track and off-track. It helps in making informed decisions during races and testing sessions. The data will eventually be available on a public website for broader access.

## Features
- Real-time collection of CAN data from car to DB using LoRa transmission
- Integration with MongoDB Atlas for secure data storage
- Planned public data sharing through a website

## Future Plans
- **Website**: Public display of performance data
- **Past Data**: Create charts/information from past data
